#  Time Series Analysis With LSTMs and Transformers
In this study, writed a simple stock market predictor for Tesla. Dataset is in **TSLA.csv** file that uploaded. 

### Part 1: Prediction with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

Train a stock value predictor using LSTM for this company and report the performance of your predictor: 

• Used an appropriate LSTM model.

• Trained with the first 70 percent of the data and test with the rest. 

• Reported the performance of the model.   

• Repeated the above using an additional feature. 

• Added the value of gold as input for the same date intervals and retrain the model and report performance. 

### Part 2: Prediction with Transformers

Repeat all steps in part 1 using transformers
